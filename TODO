Seems like the cube is movable during the Korf index phase.  Is it being
enabled by the TSolver?  Maybe pass in the ThreadPool.  Then each solver can
initialize in order.
Add a comment about the use of shared ptr in BFS.
There's a pattern database (GoalG3_Permate_Corners) that could be refactored to
use the new CornerPatternDatabase class.
Try to solve the cube outright, then bail at depth 10.
