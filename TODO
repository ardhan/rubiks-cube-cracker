Seems like the cube is movable during the Korf index phase.  Is it being enabled by the TSolver?
Add a comment about the use of shared ptr in BFS.
There's a pattern database (GoalG3_Permate_Corners) that could be refactored to
use the new CornerPatternDatabase class.
Try to solve the cube outright, then bail at depth 10.
