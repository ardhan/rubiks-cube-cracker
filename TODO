Delete CornerPermutation.
Remove bitset from RubiksCubeView (unused).
Remove CornerPermutationIndexer and EdgePermutationIndexer.
Make the underlying datastructure of NibbleArray a vector, otherwise there

Don't orient the cube in CubeSearcher because there are now multiple.  Orient
the cube in the RubiksCube world object.
Try to solve the cube outright, then bail at depth 10.
